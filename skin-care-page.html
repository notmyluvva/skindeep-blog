        NATURAL AFRICAN ROOTS MIXED WITH QUINTESSENTIALLY BRITISH ATTITUDE: LIHA

        While there have been steps towards diversity in the beauty industry,
        non-Caucasian women are still widely underrepresented and poorly catered
        for when it comes to hair and make-up. Step forward, Liha Beauty, the
        eponymous brand from Liha Okunniwa and Abi Oyepitan which brings African
        culture to the fore of the natural beauty product market. The pair
        bonded over natural African hair products (or a lack thereof) which led
        not only to a lasting friendship but a successful brand. "We both have
        afros and were always playing around with different products. We were
        just talking about it one day and decided we had to make our own,"
        explains Abi. They began experimenting Idan oil (natural pressed-coconut
        oil) and were soon dishing out samples to family and friends.

      <p class="interview-text-2">
        All their products are homegrown, with Nigerian shea from Abi's father's
        home in Ondo State and Ghanaian shea which they discovered on a recent
        trip there, when they also began working with the Shea Alliance, an
        organisation which partners Ghanaian women with cooperatives to ensure
        they are paid fairly for their shea, giving them a steady wage and
        independence. They are now planning to bring the initiative to Nigeria.
        But the beauty of Liha is that the products serve all skin types and age
        groups "It's for women and girls who want to look after their bodies as
        well as the environment. You've got 20 year olds who want to know what's
        in the products they're using. It's not just about beauty, but the
        wellness thing as well," says Abi. The duo signed up for the Port Eliot
        Festival in July 2014 and quickly sold out of their products. Their
        workshops soon caught the attention of buyers from Anthropology which
        resulted in products being stocked in their stores shortly after.
