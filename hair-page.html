        Maeva spent a lot of time hanging around her Mum's braiding salon in
        Perth, Australia, as a tiny and impressionable human. Beauty and hair
        products punctuated her everyday with smells and sights and textures
        made for the styling and cultivation of womanhood. She went on to spend
        her early career working behind the scenes of global 'big box' beauty
        brands. But something didn't feel right. She wasn't really acknowledged
        in mainstream hair conversations, and struggled to find clean hair
        products that were uncomplicated, practical, and fun. Yes, BREAD only
        launched in 2020. Just a hot minute ago, really. But Maeva traces the
        beginnings of BREAD back to the 90s, on that salon floor. The braiding
        tutorials, storytelling, familiar faces and close-knit community of
        women with curly, coiled and textured hair was her Mum's own version of
        BREAD.

      <p class="interview-text-2">
        BREAD BEAUTY SUPPLY is: here for the essentials. The must-haves. Like
        bread. We think you make good hair, and we make good hair products. We
        felt there was a need for a brand that would look and think differently
        for all of it: the curls, fuzz, frizzy bits, bangs, braids, bantu, other
        bits. But we don't want haircare to feel forced or chore-like anymore.
        Haircare should be fun. So we're starting small, helping you win on
        wash-day. Our kit 1- wash is the full bread basket, with all the
        essentials you need for a routine clean. Then we have other things to
        layer (and layover) between showers, like hair-oil (lip gloss for your
        strands) and hair-cream (leave-in conditioning and styling for
        all-over). Like fresh treats from *that* one local bakery or restocking
        your signature brand of soy milk, the 'essentials' can be exciting when
        you know where to look, and when you find what's right for you.
