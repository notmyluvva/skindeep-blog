      <h2>OH, HE IS THE MOMENT HONEY: JULIAN STOLLER</h2>

      <p class="interview-text">
        Boasting 2.4 million followers and a client base that includes Julia
        Fox, Rosalía and Ashnikko, few in the makeup industry have seen the
        dizzying heights of success reached by Julian Stoller. However despite
        the makeup artist's Instagram lifestyle, outwardly looking to be all
        glamorous events and celebrity clientele, Julian is refreshingly down to
        earth, acknowledging his roots and support system every chance he gets.
        We recently spoke to the New York based creative about his start in the
        industry, his career-defining moments, the people that have made it
        happen and his recent collaboration with Morphe; “a brand that truly
        believes in the artist and the artist's vision.” “I've always been in
        love with anything beauty [related]. My mum constantly reminds me that
        as a little kid, I would compliment my teachers from kindergarten. I'd
        walk up and say 'Your makeup looks so beautiful', little things like
        that,” he explains. “Even watching my mum and sister get ready…seeing
        them put on a red lip or mascara…I think it's something that when it's
        meant to be, it's just always inside of you,” he says. “Art is just a
        part of people and I think makeup was one of those things for me.”

      <p class="interview-text-2">
        Clearly not one to rest on his laurels however, Julian's current
        project, a brush collection with Morphe is the next addition to his
        resume and something incredibly close to his heart. “I had so many
        offers within the realms of cosmetics…to do a collaboration or start my
        own brand, and it just didn't feel right [until now],” he says. Of his
        decision to start with brushes, he says “Considering brushes are the
        fundamentals of makeup, the first company that I thought of was
        Morphe…and they have been great. They're a brand that truly believes in
        the artist and the artist's vision, it really allowed me to be creative
        and free, and that was just a no brainer.” Paying homage to the
        important people in his life, as well as how far he's come, Ariel
        explains that “each one of the brushes has a special meaning to me or
        was a significant moment in my life. I really thought about how [the
        meaning] correlates with the function of the brush.”
