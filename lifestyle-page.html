        BERLIN-PRENZLAUER BERG - You couldn't imagine a more suitable place for
        Melanie Dal Canton's small beauty empire than the area around the water
        tower. The idyllic district, where Berlin nightlife flourished after the
        fall of the Wall and where stones were always thrown on May 1st, is now
        a tranquil residential area for mature city dwellers.Dal Canton, who
        came to Berlin from Lake Constance in the 1990s, began working in
        Andreas Murkudis' legendary store on MÃ¼nzstrasse after the obligatory
        partying phase for every newcomer to Berlin. She later became managing
        director there. The knowledge she gained and the contacts she made in
        Berlin's creative bubble then offered the ideal conditions for opening
        her own shop on Knaackstrasse.
      </p>
      <p class="interview-text-2">
        She wanted to change that when she opened MCD Cosmetics ten years ago.
        And because this plan worked immediately, cosmetic treatment rooms were
        added five years later. Gentle treatments are offered here today, with
        products that can also be bought at MDC. There is detailed advice and
        the prices are also mentioned, which is authentic and personable.
        Finally, last year MDC Next Door opened, a shop for high-quality home
        products such as scented candles and unusual crockery. Another treatment
        studio will also be inaugurated in autumn. All four MDC addresses are
        within a one to two minute walking distance. But that's not the only
        reason why the brand is so popular with its regular customers: MDC
        obviously hits a nerve with the times, in which everyday life is also
        largely aestheticized. Dal Canton's passion for beauty runs through
        every fiber of the company. Starting with the design of the stores with
        their colorful fixtures, the scent that wafts through the rooms, through
        the brand selection to the clothing of the employees, which looks like
        provided by Margiela. No detail is succinctly designed here, each item
        is equipped with a special design history.
